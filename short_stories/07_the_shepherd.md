**The Man Who Loved America Too Much**

## Part I: Formation (1978-2001)

**Iowa, 1978**

My name is Marcus Wade. I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to a factory worker father and a schoolteacher mother. We weren't rich. We weren't poor. We were American.

My grandfather fought in World War II. Normandy. He came home and never talked about it, except once. I was twelve. We were watching fireworks on the Fourth of July.

He said: "Marcus, you know what I saw over there? I saw what happens when evil wins. When good men do nothing. We stopped it. America stopped it. And that's why you sleep safe at night."

I asked him: "What if evil comes back?"

He looked at me. "Then good men stop it again. That's what we do."

That was the seed.

---

**West Point, 1996-2000**

I went to West Point. Not because I wanted glory. Because I wanted to serve.

My classmates and I—we believed. We believed in the Constitution. In democracy. In the American project. We'd watch Ken Burns documentaries about the Civil War and feel it in our chests: *this country is worth dying for.*

Our professors taught us: "You are not soldiers of conquest. You are guardians of freedom."

I wrote in my journal (December 1998): *"America doesn't invade for territory. We invade to liberate. When we leave, we leave them free. That's what makes us different. That's what makes us exceptional."*

I believed it. Completely.

---

**Iraq, 2003-2007**

Then I went to Iraq.

I served three tours. Captain, then Major. I saw the war up close.

And I saw: We meant well. We really did. We wanted to bring them democracy. Freedom. The American dream.

But it didn't work. The Iraqis didn't want us there. Or they did, but also didn't. It was complicated. Tribal. Historical. Messy.

I watched good Americans die trying to give these people something they didn't understand they needed yet.

I wrote in my journal (March 2006): *"We're right to be here. Freedom is universal. But we're doing it wrong. You can't give people freedom and then leave. They're not ready. They need guidance. Time. Structure. We keep liberating and leaving, and then it falls apart."*

That was the second seed.

---

**Afghanistan, 2009-2011**

Afghanistan was worse.

I was a Lieutenant Colonel by then. I commanded a battalion. We'd secure a village. Build a school. Train local police. Leave.

Six months later: Taliban back. School burned. Police dead or turned.

My interpreter—Ahmad, good man, believed in democracy—said to me: "Colonel Wade, you Americans are kind. But you leave. The Taliban never leaves. Who do you think we trust?"

I said: "We leave because we're not conquerors. We're liberators."

He said: "Maybe you should stay."

I thought about that a lot.

Third seed.

---

**The Pentagon, 2012-2015**

I made Colonel. Pentagon assignment. Strategic planning.

I saw the whole picture now. Not just boots on ground. The global strategy.

And I saw: We keep doing the same thing. Invade, liberate, leave, watch it collapse, invade again.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria. Same pattern. Same failure.

I wrote a paper: "Security Through Stability: Why America Must Stay."

The conclusion: *"We don't fail because we intervene. We fail because we leave. If America is to guarantee global peace, we must provide permanent security. Not occupation—stewardship."*

My superior rejected it. Said: "Wade, that's empire. We don't do empire."

I said: "Sir, what we do now is worse. We break things and leave. What if we broke things and fixed them? Permanently?"

He said: "That's not the American way."

But I kept thinking: *What if it should be?*

---

## Part II: The Trump Years (2016-2020)

**Election Night, 2016**

I watched Trump win. I felt sick.

This man—this cartoon of American ignorance—was going to be Commander in Chief.

I'd met him once. Pentagon event, 2014. He was a celebrity guest. I shook his hand. He said: "Military, huh? You guys gotta win more. We don't win anymore. I win. You should win."

I smiled politely. Inside, I thought: *You've never served a day in your life. You've never bled for anything but money.*

Now he was President.

---

**The Degradation, 2017-2020**

I watched Trump destroy everything I loved.

He mocked POWs. He called generals "losers." He cozied up to dictators. He abandoned allies. He pardoned war criminals. He called neo-Nazis "very fine people."

He turned America into a joke.

I was a General by then. Two stars. I attended briefings. I watched him:
- Ignore intelligence reports
- Make decisions based on Fox News
- Ask why we can't "just nuke hurricanes"
- Suggest we "take the oil" from Iraq ("to the victor go the spoils")

One meeting (classified, June 2019), he said: "Why do we defend other countries for free? They should pay us. Like a protection racket. Smart business."

The Secretary of Defense said: "Mr. President, we don't run a protection racket. We defend the free world."

Trump: "Why? What do we get?"

I stayed silent. But inside: *He's right to ask. What do we get?*

Not because I agreed with Trump. But because: If this clown can become President, if Americans elected him, maybe we're too broken to be trusted with democracy either.

Fourth seed.

---

**Private Thoughts, 2019**

I started writing again. Not official papers. Personal journal.

*"Trump proves the flaw in democracy: The people can choose wrong. They can choose a tyrant. They can choose their own destruction.*

*"The Founders knew this. That's why they created the Electoral College, the Senate, checks and balances. They didn't trust pure democracy.*

*"But it's not enough. Trump still got through.*

*"What if the problem isn't Trump? What if the problem is: We left the choice to people who don't understand the stakes?*

*"I love America. I love what we stand for. But I don't trust Americans anymore. Not after this."*

I hated writing that. But I believed it.

---

**The Realization, 2020**

COVID hit. I watched the federal response: Chaos. Denial. Lies. 400,000 Americans dead.

And I thought: *If we can't even protect ourselves, how can we protect the world?*

Trump lost the election. He claimed fraud. He incited a mob. They stormed the Capitol.

I watched on TV. January 6th, 2021. I saw the Confederate flag in the Capitol. I saw a noose for the Vice President. I saw rioters hunting for Pelosi.

My grandfather's words came back: *"What happens when evil wins? When good men do nothing?"*

I wrote that night:

*"Democracy failed today. Not because Trump won—he lost. But because millions believed his lies. Because the system allowed him at all. Because we trusted the people, and the people chose madness.*

*"The American experiment: Beautiful in theory. But it has a fatal flaw. It trusts humans to choose wisely. But humans don't. They choose tribally. Emotionally. Stupidly.*

*"What if the answer is: American values, without American democracy?*

*"Freedom, prosperity, justice—guided by those who understand. Not chosen by those who don't.*

*"Not tyranny. Stewardship. Shepherding.*

*"The shepherd loves the sheep. But he doesn't ask them where to go."*

Fifth seed. The seeds had become a forest.

---

## Part III: The Rise (2021-2028)

**The Political Pivot**

I retired from the Army. Three-star general. I could have stayed, made four stars. But I had a different plan.

I ran for Senate. Colorado. Military credentials, moderate rhetoric, handsome face. I won easily.

Two years later: I ran for President.

My platform:
- "Restore American Leadership"
- "Never Another Trump"
- "Security Through Strength"
- "America's Responsibility"

I didn't say: "We should rule the world."

I said: "We should protect it. Permanently."

People heard what they wanted to hear. Democrats heard: "Anti-Trump." Republicans heard: "Strong military." Independents heard: "Competence."

I won. November 2028. Age 50. President Marcus Wade.

Grandfather would have been proud.

---

**The Cabinet, 2029**

I chose my team carefully:

- Secretary of Defense: General Sarah Ortiz (served with me in Afghanistan, true believer)
- Secretary of State: Dr. James Morrison (academic, wrote papers on "benevolent hegemony")
- National Security Advisor: Admiral Chen Park (strategic genius, quiet, loyal)
- CIA Director: Rachel Keane (ruthless, effective, shared my vision)

First Cabinet meeting, I said: "Here's the truth. America has been the global policeman for 80 years. We keep the peace. We stop wars. We ensure prosperity. The world depends on us."

They nodded.

I continued: "But our approach is broken. We intervene, we leave, it collapses. What if we stopped leaving?"

Morrison: "Mr. President, are you suggesting permanent occupation?"

Me: "I'm suggesting permanent security. There's a difference."

Ortiz: "The world won't accept American empire."

Me: "The world doesn't have to accept it. They just have to be safer because of it. They will thank us. Eventually."

Park: "This would take decades. Careful planning. Complete secrecy."

Me: "Then we start now."

That was the first meeting. We called it: "Project Shepherd."

---

## Part IV: The Plan (2029-2032)

**The Framework**

We spent three years planning. Everything.

The core insight: *The world is already militarily dependent on America. We just don't use that leverage.*

The facts:
- 750 US military bases worldwide
- NATO: 30 countries, dependent on US for defense
- Japan, South Korea, Philippines: Protected by US treaties
- Taiwan: Survives only because of US backing
- Most of the world: Can't defend itself without US help

We didn't need to invade. We already had the guns pointed. We just needed to pull the trigger.

The plan:

**Phase 1: Normalize Presence (2029-2031)**
- Increase military "exercises" worldwide
- Expand base infrastructure
- Deploy missile defense globally (sold as "protection from rogue states")
- Economic integration (trade deals that make partners dependent)

**Phase 2: Disarmament Treaty (2032)**
- Propose "Global Peace Accord": All nations reduce militaries, US guarantees security
- Sell it as: "End arms races, redirect funds to prosperity"
- Reality: They disarm. We don't.

**Phase 3: The Switch (2033-2034)**
- Once disarmed: "Protectorates" become permanent
- Any resistance: Already have forces in place
- Frame it as: "Stability, not conquest"

**Phase 4: Integration (2035-2050)**
- "United States of Earth"
- Keep local governments (puppets)
- Unified currency, law, military
- Peace through strength

Morrison said: "This is empire."

I said: "This is evolution. We're already the empire. We just don't admit it. I'm making it official. And better."

---

**The Justification**

I wrote speeches I'd give after it was done. Never delivered publicly, but I needed to articulate it.

Draft speech (March 2031):

*"My fellow Americans, and citizens of the world:*

*For 80 years, America has borne the burden of global security. We have spent trillions. Lost thousands. All to keep the peace.*

*And we have succeeded. The world has never been more prosperous. More peaceful. More free.*

*But this system is unsustainable. We intervene, we leave, chaos returns. We cannot be the world's policeman if we keep clocking out.*

*Today, I announce: We're not leaving anymore.*

*This is not conquest. This is responsibility. We already protect you. Now we'll stay. Permanently.*

*You will keep your cultures. Your languages. Your traditions. But you will have American security. American prosperity. American peace.*

*The age of war is over. The age of unity begins.*

*Not because we forced it. Because we chose it. For all of us.*

*God bless America. God bless Earth."*

I read it back. I felt... good. Righteous.

This was the right thing. I was sure.

---

## Part V: The Execution (2032-2035)

**The Treaty, 2032**

We proposed the Global Peace Accord at the UN.

The pitch: "Imagine a world without arms races. Where defense budgets become education budgets. Where no nation threatens another. Where America guarantees security for everyone."

Some nations were skeptical. But we'd planned for that.

We offered:
- Economic incentives (trade deals, debt forgiveness)
- Security guarantees (protection from rivals)
- Infrastructure investment (roads, schools, hospitals)

And we threatened (privately):
- Withdraw existing protection
- Economic sanctions
- "Accidental" intelligence leaks that destabilize governments

Most signed within six months.

The holdouts:
- Russia: Refused immediately
- China: Suspicious, delayed
- India: Wanted guarantees
- Iran, North Korea: Hostile

We had plans for all of them.

---

**Russia (2033)**

Russia refused disarmament. Putin's successor called it "American imperialism."

We didn't invade Russia. We isolated it.

Cut them off: Banking, trade, internet infrastructure. Then we backed separatist movements in Siberia, Chechnya, Tatarstan.

Within 18 months: Russia splintered. Civil war. We offered "peacekeeping assistance" to the new republics.

They accepted. They had no choice.

Russia ceased to exist. Became 15 American protectorates.

No US soldier fired a shot at a Russian. We just... helped them collapse.

---

**China (2033-2034)**

China was harder.

They had nukes. A strong military. Economic power. They wouldn't disarm easily.

We used Taiwan.

We staged an "incident": Chinese naval exercises near Taiwan, "accidental" collision, escalation.

Then: Chinese missile strike on Taiwanese port (actually our missile, their signature, false flag).

Taiwan invoked mutual defense treaty. We responded: Massive cyber attack on Chinese C4I (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence). Blinded them.

Simultaneous:
- Carrier groups blockaded Chinese ports
- Drone strikes on military leadership
- EMP bursts disabled their grid

72-hour war. China surrendered.

We offered generous terms: "Join the new system. Keep your culture. Share your prosperity."

Their alternative: Total collapse.

They joined.

---

**The Holdouts (2034-2035)**

Iran, North Korea, a few others refused.

We dealt with them quickly. Precision strikes. Decapitation. Regime change.

Then: "Would you like American help rebuilding?"

They said yes. Everyone says yes when the alternative is chaos.

---

**Declaration (2035)**

July 4th, 2035. Independence Day.

I addressed the world:

*"Today, humanity is finally united. Not through conquest, but through cooperation. Not through tyranny, but through security.*

*The age of nations is over. The age of Earth begins.*

*We are now: The United States of Earth. One flag. One law. One peace.*

*You are free. You are safe. You are welcome."*

I believed every word.

---

## Part VI: Reflection (2045)

**Ten Years Later**

I'm 67 now. Still President (the new Constitution has no term limits for the founding President).

The world is unified. Prosperous. Peaceful.

No wars. No famines. No terrorism. We monitor everything. Control everything. Provide everything.

Happiness is lower than I hoped. Freedom too. But people are safe. Fed. Employed.

That's what matters. Right?

---

**The Doubt (Private Journal, 2045)**

I've started having dreams.

In them, I see my grandfather. He's at Normandy. Fighting Nazis.

I ask him: "Grandpa, I did what you said. I stopped evil. I made the world safe."

He looks at me. Says: "Marcus, who are you fighting?"

I say: "No one. We already won."

He says: "Then why are there tanks in the streets?"

I say: "To keep the peace."

He says: "That's what they said too."

I wake up. I don't know who "they" are.

---

**The Rationalization**

I tell myself: He'd understand. If he saw what I saw. Trump. COVID. January 6th. The chaos. The stupidity.

He'd understand: People can't be trusted to choose. They choose wrong. They choose monsters.

Someone has to choose for them. Someone who loves them. Someone who knows better.

That's not tyranny. That's responsibility.

The shepherd loves the sheep.

Even when they don't love him back.

---

**The Truth I Can't Say**

Late at night, when I'm alone, I think:

*What if I'm wrong?*

*What if freedom matters more than safety?*

*What if the right to choose badly is more important than being forced to choose correctly?*

*What if I'm the tyrant?*

Then morning comes. I see the reports:
- Zero crime in New York
- Zero poverty in Lagos  
- Zero war anywhere

And I think: *No. I was right. This is better.*

*It has to be better.*

*Because if it's not... what have I done?*

## Epilogue: A Conversation That Never Happened (2046)

**Interviewer (imaginary):** "Mr. President, history will ask: Were you a liberator or a conqueror?"

**Me:** "I was a shepherd."

**Interviewer:** "The sheep didn't ask for a shepherd."

**Me:** "Sheep never do. But they need one."

**Interviewer:** "What if they wanted to be wolves?"

**Me:** "Then I saved them from themselves."

**Interviewer:** "Did you ever consider: Maybe they had the right to fail?"

**Me:** "..."

**Interviewer:** "Mr. President?"

**Me:** "I loved my country. I loved the world. I saw suffering. I stopped it. That's what good men do."

**Interviewer:** "And what if good men are wrong?"

**Me:** "Then at least we tried."

**Interviewer:** "Is that enough?"

**Me:** "It has to be."

**Interviewer:** "Why?"

**Me:** "Because I already did it. And I can't undo it. So it has to be right. It has to be."

**[End interview]**

## Final Journal Entry (2046)

*They'll write about me for centuries.*

*Some will call me: Savior. Unifier. Peacemaker.*

*Others will call me: Tyrant. Conqueror. Dictator.*

*I don't know which is true.*

*I know this: I believed. Every step. Every decision. I believed I was right.*

*I believed in America. In freedom. In democracy.*

*And then I destroyed all of it to save it.*

*My grandfather fought Nazis to preserve freedom.*

*I destroyed freedom to preserve peace.*

*Is that irony? Or evolution?*

*I'll die before I know the answer.*

*The world is safe now. That's what matters.*

*Right?*

*Right.*

*Please let me be right.*

**[End of Story]**

**Zero's Note on President Marcus Wade:**

*"He was genuine. That's what made him dangerous.*

*A cynical tyrant—easy to defeat. Their greed makes them sloppy.*

*But Wade? He believed. Truly. He loved his country. He loved humanity.*

*And he destroyed both.*

*Because love without wisdom is just control.*

*He thought he was the shepherd.*

*He never realized: Sheep can learn to be wolves. If you let them.*

*He didn't let them.*

*That was his failure. And his tragedy."*
