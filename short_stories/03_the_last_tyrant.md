## Synopsis

Viktor Molotov has ruled for two years. His regime controls 180 million people through surveillance, violence, and fear. But the protests are growing. The resistance is organizing. His generals are nervous. He knows what's coming—he's studied history. Every tyrant before him fell. But he believes he's different. He's smarter. He has better technology. He'll be the one who breaks the cycle.

He's wrong.

This is his last week alive.

## DAY ONE: Sunday, March 15, 2050

### Morning

I watch the protests from my office. Fifty thousand people in Moscow. Two hundred thousand in Petersburg. Half a million in Yekaterinburg.

They chant my name. "Molotov must fall! Molotov must fall!"

I've heard it before. For two years, they've chanted. For two years, I've stood.

My aide, Dmitri, stands at the window with me. "Premier, the military requests authorization to disperse the crowds."

"Denied," I say. "Let them tire themselves out."

"Sir, intelligence suggests the crowds are larger than previous protests. More organized."

I turn to him. He's young. Thirty-two. Doesn't remember the old days. Doesn't remember when Russia was weak.

"Dmitri, how many tyrants have fallen in the past fifty years?"

He thinks. "Fourteen, sir. Since 2000."

"And how did they fall?"

"The crowds, sir. The protests. The resistance."

"Wrong." I turn back to the window. "They fell because they were weak. They fell because they lost nerve. They fell because they stopped being willing to do what's necessary."

I gesture at the crowds below. "Those people? They're not dangerous. They're loud. But loud isn't dangerous. What's dangerous is when I start listening to them. When I start caring what they think. When I hesitate."

"I don't hesitate."

---

### Afternoon

The Security Council meeting. Fifteen men around a mahogany table. Generals, intelligence chiefs, ministers. They all report the same thing: protests growing, resistance emboldened, military morale declining.

General Koslov speaks. "Premier, we've identified the resistance leadership. Anastasia Volkov and her inner circle. We know where they are. We could—"

"No," I interrupt.

The table goes quiet.

"No?" Koslov says carefully.

"If we kill Volkov, she becomes a martyr. Her movement grows. Someone else takes her place."

"Then what do you suggest, Premier?"

I smile. "We let them think they're winning. We let them organize. We let them gather in one place, confident and exposed. Then we end it. All at once. Completely."

Koslov nods slowly. "A trap."

"Precisely. Announce a 'dialogue.' Invite resistance leaders to negotiations. Public, televised, the world watching. They'll come—they can't refuse without looking afraid. Once they're in the building..."

I don't finish the sentence. I don't need to.

The faces around the table: Some show approval. Some show disgust. All show understanding.

"That's... that would be unprecedented, sir," says Minister Petrov.

"Every tyrant before me played by rules," I say. "That's why they fell. I don't play by rules."

---

### Evening

I dine alone. Beef stroganoff, vodka, bread. Simple food. My father's food. He was a factory worker in Novosibirsk. Died when I was twelve. Heart attack from stress and poverty.

I swore I'd never be powerless like him. Never beg for scraps. Never work myself to death for nothing.

Now I rule 180 million people.

Success.

My wife died three years ago. Cancer. We had no children—I was always working. My siblings don't speak to me. They say I've changed. They're not wrong.

I eat alone because that's what power costs. And I've paid it gladly.

After dinner, I watch old footage. Putin's speeches. Stalin's paranoia. Lukashenko's stubbornness. I study them. What made them last? What made them fall?

Putin: Lasted 30+ years. Died in office. Secret? Never showed weakness. Never apologized.

Stalin: Died in power. Secret? Made everyone afraid. Even his inner circle.

Lukashenko: Fell in 2035. Why? Lost his nerve. Started negotiating.

The lesson is clear: Strength wins. Hesitation loses.

I won't hesitate.

---

## DAY TWO: Monday, March 16, 2050

### Morning

The protests have doubled. One million in Moscow. The largest I've seen.

I make the announcement myself. Televised, broadcast nationwide.

"My fellow citizens. I hear your voices. I hear your concerns. In the spirit of dialogue, I invite the resistance leadership to meet with me. Publicly. Televised. This Friday, March 20th, at the Grand Kremlin Palace. Let us talk. Let us find a path forward together."

The words taste like poison. But they work.

Within hours, Volkov releases a statement: She'll attend. She has demands. She wants guarantees.

I give them. Constitutional reform. Free elections. Amnesty for political prisoners.

All lies. But she doesn't know that.

Dmitri asks me after the broadcast: "Sir, are you... are you serious about negotiations?"

I look at him. Really look at him. "Dmitri, do you think I've held power for two years by being serious about anything except keeping power?"

He doesn't answer.

"That's what I thought. Now go. Prepare security for Friday. Make sure our friends in the military are ready."

He leaves. I watch him go. He'll betray me eventually. They all do. But not before Friday.

---

### Afternoon

Intelligence report lands on my desk. Thick file. Photos. Names. Locations.

The resistance is larger than I thought. Two million active members. Ten million supporters. Networks in every city.

There's a map. Cells highlighted in red. Everywhere. Everywhere.

For the first time, I feel something I haven't felt in years.

Doubt.

Can I actually win this?

I push the thought away. Doubt is weakness. Weakness is death.

I study Anastasia Volkov's file instead. Age 34. Former journalist. Imprisoned 2048-2049 (I authorized that). Released due to international pressure (mistake). Now: resistance leader, symbol of defiance, face of the movement.

She's beautiful. Smart. Charismatic. Everything a revolutionary should be.

I hate her.

Not because she threatens me. But because she believes. She actually believes in what she's fighting for.

I haven't believed in anything for twenty years.

That makes her dangerous. Believers are harder to kill than pragmatists. Pragmatists negotiate. Believers die first.

Friday, she'll die.

---

### Evening

A call from my old friend, Alexei. We grew up together in Novosibirsk. He's a doctor now. Stayed out of politics.

"Viktor," he says. "Are you all right?"

"Why wouldn't I be?"

"The protests. The pressure. I worry about you."

I almost laugh. "Alexei, I'm fine. I'm in control."

"That's what Karimov said. And Lukashenko. And—"

"I'm not them."

Silence.

"Viktor... is it worth it?"

"Is what worth it?"

"This. The power. The violence. The fear. You used to be... different."

"I used to be poor," I say. "I used to be nobody. Now I'm somebody. So yes. It's worth it."

"Even if you die for it?"

"Everyone dies, Alexei. But not everyone rules. I'd rather die a tyrant than live a peasant."

He hangs up.

I pour more vodka.

---

## DAY THREE: Tuesday, March 17, 2050

### Morning

The protests continue. Two million now. They're organizing. Supply lines, medical tents, coordination centers.

They're learning. Every protest is more sophisticated than the last.

I call General Koslov. "Move up the timeline."

"Sir?"

"Friday is too long. Thursday. We do it Thursday."

"But sir, the announcement said Friday. If we—"

"I don't care. Thursday. That's an order."

I hang up.

My hands are shaking. I don't know why. I don't shake.

---

### Afternoon

A delegation from the European Union arrives. "Mediation," they call it. Interference, I call it.

The ambassador—a German woman, stern face—sits across from me.

"Premier Molotov, the international community is watching. We urge restraint. We urge genuine dialogue. We urge—"

"You urge submission," I interrupt. "You want me to step down. Admit defeat. Hand power to the mob."

"We want democratic transition."

"Democracy," I spit the word. "You mean chaos. You mean weakness. You mean Russia on its knees again, begging the West for loans."

"We mean freedom."

I lean forward. "Ambassador, let me tell you about freedom. Freedom is what you have when you're strong enough to take it. Not when someone gives it to you. These protesters? They're not free. They're manipulated. By foreign agents, by NGOs, by people like you."

"That's paranoid—"

"Is it? Or is it pattern recognition? I've watched every resistance movement for fifty years. They all have the same playbook. The same funding sources. The same rhetoric. You think I don't see it?"

She stands. "This conversation is over."

"Yes. It is. And tell your masters: Russia doesn't kneel. Not to you. Not to anyone."

She leaves.

I was too aggressive. Dmitri tells me after. I should have been diplomatic. Kept the EU neutral.

He's right. But I don't care. I'm tired of pretending.

---

### Evening

I can't sleep. I pace my office. Three AM.

The city is quiet. The protesters sleep. Tomorrow they'll wake and protest again.

I think about my father. The factory worker. Powerless. Dead at 54.

I think about Putin. Powerful. Dead at 81.

I think about Volkov. Young. Alive. Believer.

I think about Friday. Thursday now. The trap. The end.

Will it work?

Of course it will. I've planned everything.

But what if it doesn't?

What if she doesn't come?

What if the military refuses?

What if—

No. Doubt is weakness.

I pour vodka. Drink. Repeat.

By dawn, the bottle is empty. And I still can't sleep.

---

## DAY FOUR: Wednesday, March 18, 2050

### Morning

The protest reaches critical mass. Five million people. Across the entire Federation.

The military reports: Some units are refusing orders. Not many. But some.

I issue execution orders. Ten soldiers. Shot for insubordination. Televised.

It works. The rest fall in line.

But I see it in their eyes. Fear. Not of the protesters. Of me.

That's fine. Fear is control.

---

### Afternoon

Volkov releases a video. She's standing in front of a massive crowd. She speaks:

"Tomorrow, I will meet with Premier Molotov. I do not trust him. But I trust you. And I trust history. Every tyrant falls. Every. Single. One. Molotov will be no different. Tomorrow, we begin the end. For freedom. For Russia. For all of us."

The crowd roars.

I watch the video three times.

She knows. She knows it's a trap.

But she's coming anyway.

Why?

Because she believes. Because she thinks martyrdom serves the cause.

She's right. It does.

But she'll be dead. And I'll be alive.

That's the only metric that matters.

---

### Evening

I write a letter. Just in case.

To whom it may concern:

I, Viktor Molotov, Premier of the Reformed Russian Federation, write this in sound mind and full awareness.

If you are reading this, I am likely dead. Killed by the mob. Executed by the resistance. Murdered by traitors.

I do not regret my actions. I ruled. I held power. I did what was necessary. If that makes me a tyrant, so be it. Better to die a tyrant than live a slave.

History will judge me. I don't care what verdict it reaches. History is written by winners. And winners lie.

I leave no fortune. No family. No legacy but memory and fear.

That's enough.

Viktor Molotov
March 18, 2050

I seal it. Put it in my desk. Probably melodramatic. But just in case.

---

## DAY FIVE: Thursday, March 19, 2050

### Morning

The day.

I dress carefully. Black suit. Red tie. The colors of power.

Dmitri briefs me. "Security is in place. Snipers on rooftops. Troops in basement. Exits sealed. Once Volkov enters the building, we control everything."

"Good."

"Sir... are you certain about this?"

"Dmitri, are you having doubts?"

"No, sir. Just... she's coming with her entire leadership. Twelve people. If we kill them all, on live television..."

"The resistance dies with them."

"Or becomes unstoppable."

I turn to him. "Which is it, Dmitri? Do we act or do we die?"

He doesn't answer.

"That's what I thought. Get out. I'll see you at the palace."

He leaves. And I know: He's going to betray me. Today. Tomorrow. Soon.

They all do.

---

### Afternoon - The Trap

The Grand Kremlin Palace. Cameras everywhere. The world is watching.

I wait in the main hall. Gold walls. High ceilings. Imperial grandeur.

Volkov enters with eleven others. Her inner circle. Walking to their deaths.

She sees me. I see her.

For a moment, we just stare.

She's not afraid. That unsettles me.

I should speak first. Assert dominance.

"Anastasia Volkov. Thank you for coming."

"Premier Molotov. Thank you for the invitation." Her voice is steady. "Shall we begin?"

"Yes. Let's begin."

I signal Koslov. He should give the order now. Seal the doors. End this.

He doesn't.

I signal again.

He looks away.

And I understand.

They've turned. Not just Dmitri. All of them.

I'm alone.

---

### The End

Volkov sees it too. My realization. She allows herself a small smile.

"Viktor," she says quietly. "It's over."

The doors burst open. Not my soldiers. Hers. Resistance fighters. Hundreds of them.

My guards step aside. They were hers all along.

I reach for my pistol. It's not there. Someone took it.

I'm surrounded. Unarmed. Alone.

For the first time in two years, I feel fear.

Volkov approaches. "You thought you could trap me. But Viktor, we trapped you. Every step. Every plan. We knew. We've always known."

"How?" My voice cracks.

"Because we're organized. Because we're united. Because while you were busy being cruel, we were busy being smart."

She signals her people. They grab my arms.

"What happens now?" I ask.

"Trial," she says. "Then prison. Then—we'll see."

"I'll escape. I always do."

"No, Viktor. You won't. Because unlike you, we're not cruel. But we're not stupid either. You're done."

---

## Epilogue: March 22, 2050

### Trial

They hold it in the same palace. Three days later. Public. Televised.

I'm accused of crimes against humanity. Murder. Torture. Corruption.

All true. I don't deny it.

My defense: "I did what was necessary to save Russia from chaos."

The court doesn't care.

Verdict: Guilty.

Sentence: Life imprisonment. (The crowd wanted death. Volkov refused. She says they're better than me. Maybe they are.)

---

### Prison

I'm in a cell now. Three meters by four. No windows. A bed. A toilet. A desk.

I write. That's all there is to do.

I write my memoirs. "The Last Tyrant." That's what they're calling me. The last great dictator. The end of a cycle.

I wanted to break the pattern. Instead, I proved it. Every tyrant falls.

I just thought I'd be different.

---

### Final Entry: June 30, 2050

Three months imprisoned.

I've had time to think. To reflect. To regret.

Do I regret?

No.

I held power. For two years. Two years as a king. That's more than most get in a lifetime.

Was it worth it? The fear, the violence, the loneliness?

Yes.

Because for two years, I wasn't my father. I wasn't powerless. I wasn't nobody.

I was Viktor Molotov. Premier. Tyrant. Somebody.

And even now, in this cell, I'm still somebody. Remembered. Feared. Hated.

That's legacy.

The resistance thinks they won. And they did. They beat me.

But I made them strong. Every dictator makes resistance stronger. That's the paradox.

Without me, they'd have no purpose. No unity. No story.

I gave them meaning.

You're welcome.

---

**Note Found in Cell, July 15, 2050:**

Viktor Molotov died last night. Heart attack. Age 67.

Or so they say.

His guards claim natural causes.

But rumor says: The guards. Quietly. In the night. Couldn't risk escape.

No one knows. No one admits.

But everyone understands.

The last tyrant is dead.

The age of dictators: Over.

Or is it?

History says: There's always another.

But Gamma-7 says: Not this time. Not anymore.

They learned.

Finally, they learned.

---

## Discussion Questions

1. **Was Viktor redeemable?** He wasn't born evil. He came from poverty, worked hard, rose to power. At what point did he become the villain?

2. **Did he have a point?** His father died powerless. Viktor swore never to be weak. Is the desire for power inherently evil, or just human?

3. **The trap within a trap:** Viktor thought he was setting a trap for Volkov. She was setting one for him. Who was smarter? Or was Viktor always doomed?

4. **"Better to die a tyrant than live a peasant":** Do you agree? Is power worth any cost? Or is there a limit?

5. **The last tyrant:** The story says he's the last. But is he? Will there always be another? Or did Gamma-7 finally break the cycle?

6. **Zero's role:** Zero supported Viktor (gave him luck, kept him in power longer than natural). Is Zero responsible for Viktor's crimes? Or is Viktor alone responsible?

---

## Author's Note

Viktor Molotov is not sympathetic. He's cruel, paranoid, and selfish.

But he's human.

He came from nothing. His father died powerless. Viktor swore: Never again.

So he climbed. And climbed. And became the thing he feared most: Someone willing to crush others for power.

The tragedy isn't that he became a tyrant. The tragedy is that he thought it was worth it.

Even at the end, even in prison, he doesn't regret. He held power for two years. To him, that justifies everything.

That's the horror. Not that tyrants are monsters. But that they're humans who chose monstrosity. And they'd choose it again.

Viktor is the last great dictator in Gamma-7. Zero supported him deliberately. To forge the final resistance. To teach the ultimate lesson.

It worked. Viktor fell. The resistance won. The age of tyrants ended.

But at what cost?

Ask Viktor. He'll tell you: Worth it.

Ask the 45 million dead. They'll disagree.

That's Gamma-7. That's the Forge.
