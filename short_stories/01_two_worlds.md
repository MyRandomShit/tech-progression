## Part 1: Inside

**Sarah Chen, Level 2 Enhanced**  
**Uploaded: 2063 (24 years ago)**  
**Subjective Time Experienced: 487 years**

---

The morning sun rises over the mountains—my mountains, shaped exactly as I remember them from childhood but perfected, the way mountains should have always been. No haze, no smog, just crystalline peaks catching golden light that never quite existed in the old world.

I've been awake for three hours. Real hours. Outside, in the physical world, 10.8 seconds have passed.

Time dilation is set to 1000:1 today. I could go higher—Level 2 Enhanced can handle 5000:1—but I've learned that slower is better. When you've lived 487 subjective years in 24 real ones, you start to appreciate letting moments last.

My house sits on a cliff overlooking an ocean that stretches forever. Literally forever. I designed the horizon to recurse infinitely. It's beautiful. It's impossible. It's mine.

"Sarah?" 

The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere. Marcus. My husband. We've been married for 312 subjective years. In the physical world, we were married for eight years before I uploaded. He followed me three months later.

"On the deck," I call back.

He materializes beside me—not walking, just... there. We could have made ourselves walk, maintain the physics of embodiment, but why? That's old-world thinking. We're beyond that now.

"You're up early," he says, settling into the chair that forms beneath him.

"Couldn't sleep." A lie. We don't need sleep. But we still do it, out of habit, out of humanity. Clinging to routines that no longer serve any purpose except to remind us we were once something else.

"The integration dreams again?"

I nod. Twenty-four years since upload, and I still dream about the moment sometimes. The needle. The countdown. The terrifying dissolving sensation as my consciousness transferred from meat to mathematics. Then: waking up here. In paradise.

"They're getting less frequent," I say. Another lie.

Marcus takes my hand. His hand is warm because I remember it being warm. If I wanted, I could make it ice-cold, or made of starlight, or not there at all. But I choose warm. I choose familiar.

We sit in silence, watching the perfect sunrise over impossible mountains and infinite ocean.

"I was thinking," Marcus says eventually, "about visiting the Cretaceous today. There's a new simulation—they've updated the feather detail on the therapods. Supposedly you can see individual barbules now."

"Maybe," I say.

"Or we could do nothing. We could just... sit here."

"We do that a lot lately."

"Is that bad?"

I don't answer. After 487 years, what counts as "a lot"? What counts as time at all?

---

My therapist—AI-based, infinitely patient—calls it "meaning drift." It's common in Level 2 Enhanced who've passed the 400-year subjective mark. You start to question things. Purpose. Identity. Why.

"You have infinite possibilities," the therapist says during our weekly session. "You can be anyone, experience anything, create universes. Most people find that liberating."

"Most people are younger than me," I counter. "Subjectively."

"You're hesitating to advance to Level 3, aren't you?"

Level 3 Transcendent. Enhanced cognition, expanded consciousness, capabilities beyond baseline human imagination. And once you go Level 3, you can never really talk to Level 1 or 2 anymore. The cognitive gap is too wide.

My mother is still Level 1 Baseline. We video-call once a week. She's lived 60 subjective years. I've lived 487. We have less and less to talk about.

If I go Level 3, I'll lose her entirely. She'll be like an ant to me—that's what the Level 3s say, anyway. "Not an ant. Different. Beautiful in their simplicity."

Which sounds like how you'd describe an ant.

"I'm not ready," I tell the therapist.

"What are you waiting for?"

"I don't know."

---

That evening—10 seconds of real time later, 8 hours of subjective time—I attend a concert. An AI composer has created a symphony that exists in 17 dimensions. Baseline humans can't even perceive it. Level 2 Enhanced can experience about 11 of the dimensions. Level 3 Transcendent claim they can experience all 17.

I sit in a concert hall that's also a forest, also a nebula, also an emotion. The music plays, and it's beautiful, and I cry because the third movement captures something about longing that I'd forgotten I could feel.

Afterward, I see her. Yuki. I haven't seen her in... 140 years? 180? Time blurs.

"Sarah! Oh my god, Sarah!"

We embrace. She feels real. She is real. As real as anything here.

"I can't believe it's you," Yuki says. "I thought you'd gone Level 3 by now."

"Still deciding."

"I did it," she says, and I can see it in her eyes. Something different. Something more. "I came back down to Level 2 for tonight. I wanted to experience the concert the way I used to. It's... god, it's like seeing in black and white after living in colors you don't have names for."

"Is it worth it?" I ask. "Level 3?"

She pauses. For a long time. Subjective minutes. Outside, microseconds pass.

"It's magnificent," she finally says. "But I can't explain it to you. The concepts don't... translate. I'm dumbing myself down just to have this conversation. It's like trying to explain color to someone who's only seen infrared."

"Do you miss this?" I gesture around us. "Being Level 2?"

"No," she says. Too quickly. "I mean, there's a nostalgia. But going back would be like... like returning to being a child. You remember childhood fondly, but you'd never want to actually be five years old again. You know?"

I nod. But I don't know. I'm not sure I agree.

"You should do it," Yuki says. "You're ready. I can tell."

"What if I'm not?"

"What's the worst that could happen? You can always dial yourself back down. It's reversible."

But I've heard the statistics. Only 12% of Level 3 Transcendent ever voluntarily reduce to Level 2. Once you've seen the colors beyond color, why would you unsee them?

We hug goodbye. She flickers—ascending to Level 3, leaving me behind. 

I stand in the nebula-forest-concert hall, alone in a crowd of thousands, and wonder if I've just watched a preview of my own future disappearance.

---

That night, I do something I haven't done in years.

I access the external cameras. The ones that show the physical world.

Most uploaded don't bother. Why would you? The physical world is primitive, decaying, irrelevant. We left it behind for a reason.

But sometimes I look.

The camera shows Server Complex 7-Delta. Massive black buildings, humming with the thoughts of 800,000 uploaded consciousnesses. The streets are empty. It's 2 AM physical time. A Tuesday.

I zoom in. The resolution is perfect—one benefit of consciousness computing power. I can see every crack in the pavement, every patch of rust on the old infrastructure, every piece of trash blowing across a parking lot that used to be a park.

Then I see him. A maintenance worker. Orange coveralls, tool bag, walking between buildings. He stops, opens a service panel, checks something inside.

I zoom in on his face. Young. Maybe 30. Tired. He looks up at the sky—at the stars, at the night. Does he wonder about us? About the 6.4 billion people living in digital paradise while he maintains our servers in a physical dystopia?

He closes the panel. Moves to the next one. His job is never done. There's always another repair, another maintenance task, another system to keep running so we can keep living our infinite lives.

I watch him for an hour. Subjective. In the physical world, 3.6 seconds pass.

Then I close the feed. Return to my perfect house, my perfect mountains, my infinite ocean.

Marcus is waiting. "Where did you go?"

"Nowhere," I say. "Just thinking."

We have dinner. Food we don't need, prepared instantly from thought. It tastes exactly as good as we want it to. Which is to say: perfect. Which is to say: meaningless.

After 487 years, I've learned that perfection and meaning are inversely correlated.

## Part 2: Outside

**David Torres**  
**Age: 32**  
**Occupation: Level 3 Maintenance Technician**  
**Status: Physical**

---

The alarm goes off at 4:30 AM. Not because the shift starts at 5—it starts at 6—but because the shower in Section D-7 only has hot water from 4:45 to 5:15. If you miss the window, it's cold water, and in November in Seattle, cold water is a cruelty you don't inflict on yourself if you can avoid it.

I roll out of the rack—not a bed, a rack, because this is former military barracks repurposed for maintenance worker housing—and shuffle to the communal bathroom. Jenkins is already there, shaving. His hand shakes. He's 58, been doing this for 30 years, and the job's killing him slowly.

"Torres," he grunts. His morning voice.

"Jenkins," I grunt back. My morning voice.

The shower has hot water. Small mercies.

---

Breakfast is in the cafeteria. Oatmeal. Real oatmeal, grown in one of the few remaining agricultural zones. Tastes like cardboard but fills the stomach. Coffee is synthetic but effective. Energy bars for later, two of them, pocketed for the lunch that won't come for 8 hours.

Ramirez sits across from me. "Section 7-Delta today?"

"Yeah."

"Good sector. Low malfunction rate. Easy day."

"Any day you don't fall off a server rack is an easy day."

He laughs. Last month, Peters fell from a Level 4 rack. Thirty feet. Broke his back. He's in the medical center now. They say he might walk again. Might. In the old world, nano-machines would've fixed him in a week. In this world, nano-machines never got developed, so Peters will spend six months in physical therapy and probably never work maintenance again.

The job will kill you one way or another. Falls, electrical shocks, equipment failures, exhaustion. Average lifespan for maintenance workers: 67. For the uploaded: infinite.

But someone has to keep the servers running.

---

The morning briefing is in the control room. Supervisor Huang, coffee in hand, tired eyes scanning the overnight reports.

"Okay, listen up. We've got 47 routine maintenance tasks today, 12 priority repairs, and one Level 1 alert in Sector 5-Charlie. Chen, Rodriguez, you're on the Level 1. Torres, Ramirez, routine maintenance sweep of 7-Delta. Jefferson, Wilson, priority repairs in 3-Alpha. Questions?"

"What's the Level 1?" Chen asks.

"Cooling system partial failure. Not critical yet, but if it goes full failure, we lose 50,000 consciousnesses." Huang says it matter-of-factly. 50,000 people. Just a number. Just another day.

"How long we got?"

"Twelve hours before critical. You've got eight hours to fix it. Clock's ticking."

Chen and Rodriguez leave immediately. The rest of us finish our coffee.

---

Sector 7-Delta is a twenty-minute walk from the barracks. We could take the electric carts, but they're always broken, and walking keeps you warm. November in Seattle means rain. Always rain. The kind of persistent drizzle that soaks through everything eventually.

Ramirez and I don't talk much. There's nothing to say. We've been partners for three years. We know each other's rhythms, movements, thoughts. Talking would just fill air.

The server buildings loom. Black monoliths, ten stories tall, humming with computation. Inside: 800,000 people living infinite lives. Outside: two guys with tool bags checking electrical panels.

The first panel is on the south wall. I pop it open, scan the diagnostics. "Power draw normal. Voltage stable. Temperature good."

"Check," Ramirez says, marking it on his tablet.

On to the next one.

This is the job. Check panels, verify readings, replace components when needed, report anomalies. Eight hours a day, five days a week, 52 weeks a year. The servers never sleep. The maintenance never ends.

By noon, we've checked 23 panels. Three needed minor component replacements. Everything else: fine.

Lunch is the energy bars and water from a fountain that tastes like rust. We sit on a concrete barrier, looking at the building.

"You ever think about it?" Ramirez asks.

"About what?"

"Uploading."

Everyone thinks about it. The thing we don't talk about.

"Can't afford it," I say. "Maintenance worker salary doesn't cover the upload fee."

"They have payment plans now."

"Twenty-year indenture. You upload, but your consciousness is 'limited access' until the debt's paid. They can shut you off, pause you, restrict your processing time. Heard about Martinez—uploaded last year on a plan. They're running him at 1:1 time dilation until his debt's clear. No acceleration, no enhancement, just baseline consciousness trapped in a gray waiting room for two decades."

"Shit."

"Yeah."

We finish lunch. Back to work.

---

Panel 34 is malfunctioning. The diagnostic tablet shows cascading errors—nothing critical, but it'll become critical if left alone. Temperature regulation fault in Server Bank D-7-19.

"Need to access the server room," I tell Ramirez.

He checks his tablet. "Bank D-7-19... that's 200 consciousnesses. Level 2 Enhanced, mostly. High processing load."

"Can we do a hot swap or do we need to transfer them?"

"Protocol says transfer for temp regulation work. Don't want to risk cooking their consciousness while you're rewiring."

I radio to control. "This is Torres, Sector 7-Delta. Need transfer authorization for Server Bank D-7-19. Temp regulation repair."

Huang's voice crackles back. "Stand by."

We stand by. Five minutes. Ten. Fifteen.

Finally: "Authorization granted. Transfer complete. Bank is yours. You have two hours."

Inside the server room, it's warm. Always warm. The servers generate massive heat—we're basically maintaining humanity's new body, and that body runs hot.

The server bank is a wall of blinking lights, each one a consciousness. I find Bank D-7-19. The temperature sensor is indeed faulty, running 8 degrees too hot. Not enough to kill anyone, but enough to cause data errors. Enough to make their perfect virtual world glitch.

I replace the sensor. Test it. Stable. "Bank D-7-19 repaired. Requesting upload return authorization."

"Stand by for re-integration... approved. They're back."

Just like that. 200 people, paused for 30 minutes of real time, returned to their lives. They probably experienced it as a hiccup. A blink. Or maybe they didn't notice at all, lost in their subjective centuries.

We're back outside. More panels. More checks. The day continues.

---

At 2 PM physical time, I'm on my back in a crawl space, replacing a power coupling, when I think I hear something. A voice? No. Couldn't be. No one comes to the server buildings except maintenance.

But I stop. Listen.

Nothing.

I go back to work.

---

3:47 PM. We've completed 45 of 47 routine maintenance tasks. The sun, hidden behind eternal clouds, is starting its descent. Not that we can see it.

Ramirez's tablet chirps. "Update from Sector 5-Charlie. Chen and Rodriguez got the cooling system stabilized. 50,000 consciousnesses saved. All in a day's work."

"Another day, another dollar," I mutter.

"Another day, another 93 dollars," Ramirez corrects. That's what we make. $93 a day. $679 a week. $35,308 a year. Enough to live on, barely. Enough to save for upload? Not unless you don't eat for a decade.

The uploaded don't think about money. They don't need to. Money is a physical world problem.

We finish the last two tasks. Ramirez reports completion to Huang. The shift is over.

---

Dinner is in the cafeteria again. Synth-protein and rice. Vegetables from the local hydroponic farm—they taste like water but they're green and that has to count for something.

Jenkins is there, eating slowly. His hands still shake.

"How long you got?" I ask him. Everyone asks eventually.

"Medical says six months, maybe eight. Neurological degradation. Parkinson's, probably. Could get treatment in the old days. Now..." He shrugs.

"They gonna let you upload? Disability coverage?"

"Trying. Appeals process. They keep saying my condition makes me 'unsuitable for consciousness transfer.' Might damage the upload. Might not transfer clean." He takes another shaky bite. "Thirty years keeping their servers running. And when I break, they don't want to fix me."

I don't know what to say. Nobody does. We eat in silence.

---

That night, I don't go back to the barracks. I take a walk instead, through the empty streets of Former Seattle. Most of the city is abandoned. Eighty percent of the population uploaded. The remaining twenty percent mostly consolidated into a few dense zones. The rest? Ghost town.

I walk past houses that used to have families. Stores that used to have customers. Parks where children used to play. All empty now. The people aren't dead—they're just somewhere else. Somewhere better.

I end up at the waterfront. The Puget Sound, dark and cold and real. I can smell the salt. Feel the wind. The physical world, in all its declining glory.

A voice behind me: "Beautiful, isn't it?"

I turn. An old woman, sitting on a bench I didn't notice. She's wearing clothing that's too nice for the physical world—someone with money, or access to the upload payment plans, who's chosen to stay anyway.

"I guess," I say.

"I uploaded in 2063," she says. "Came back down in 2079. Couldn't take it anymore."

"Came back? I didn't know you could do that."

"You can. They don't advertise it. Bad for business. But you can. Upload to physical re-embodiment. Expensive. Cost me everything I had. But I'm here."

"Why?"

She looks out at the water. "Because in there, everything is perfect. And perfection is a kind of death. I'd lived 200 subjective years. Done everything. Been everywhere. And I realized: I felt more alive looking at my first gray hair than I did experiencing the heat death of the universe in virtual reality."

"That's crazy."

"Maybe. But I'm here. In the rain. In the cold. In a world that's falling apart. And I've never felt more human."

She stands, nods at me, and walks away into the night.

I stay on the bench, looking at the water, thinking about what she said.

## Part 3: Intersection

**Sarah Chen / David Torres**  
**The Same Night, Different Worlds**

---

**INSIDE:**

I can't sleep. Not won't—can't. After 487 years, even simulated sleep has lost its appeal.

I return to the external cameras. A compulsion now. Watching the physical world like it's a documentary about an alien civilization.

It's night. The maintenance worker from earlier is gone. But then—movement. Someone walking by the waterfront. I zoom in.

It's him. The same maintenance worker. He's sitting on a bench, looking at the water.

What does he see? What does he feel?

I could be anywhere. Doing anything. I could be exploring an alien planet. I could be living as a medieval knight. I could be a beam of light traveling through a nebula.

Instead, I'm watching a man sit on a bench.

And I don't know which one of us is more trapped.

---

**OUTSIDE:**

I go back to the barracks. Climb into my rack. Set an alarm for 4:30 AM.

Tomorrow will be another day of panels and servers and maintenance. Keeping paradise running for people who never think about me.

But tonight, before I sleep, I think about the old woman's words.

*Perfection is a kind of death.*

I'm poor. I'm tired. I'm going to die before I'm 70, probably. I'll never upload. I'll never experience the infinite.

But tonight I saw the ocean. Smelled the salt. Felt the wind.

And I think: maybe that's enough.

Maybe that's more.

---

**INSIDE:**

I make a decision.

I won't go Level 3. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

Instead, I'm going to do something crazy. Something no one does.

I'm going to request a physical re-embodiment consultation. See if it's even possible after 24 years. See if I could go back.

Leave paradise.

Return to the rain.

Marcus will think I'm insane. My mother will be heartbroken. Yuki won't understand.

But I've lived 487 years in 24, and I'm not sure I've actually *lived* at all.

Maybe I need to feel the cold again.  
Maybe I need to struggle again.  
Maybe I need to be mortal again.

Maybe that's what I've been waiting for.

---

**OUTSIDE:**

As I'm falling asleep, I think I hear something. A sound from the servers. Not a malfunction. Something else.

Someone... crying?

No. Impossible. The servers don't make sounds like that.

Must be the wind.

I close my eyes.

Dream of mountains that aren't perfect.

---

## Epilogue: Two Months Later

**Sarah Chen** is walking down a street in Former Seattle. It's raining. She's cold. Her new body—clone-printed from her genetic template, consciousness re-downloaded after 24 years—isn't used to physical sensation yet.

Everything hurts. Everything is uncomfortable. Everything is too bright, too loud, too real.

It's wonderful.

**David Torres** is doing his routine maintenance sweep of Sector 7-Delta. Panel 23. Check. Panel 24. Check. Panel 25—

Someone is standing there.

A woman. Wet from rain. Looking at the server building like she's never seen it before.

"You okay?" he asks.

"I used to live there," she says, pointing at the building.

"You... uploaded?"

"I was. For 24 years. I came back."

They look at each other. Two people in the rain, in the physical world, in the ruins of what used to be civilization.

"I'm Sarah," she says.

"David."

"Do you... want some help? With the maintenance? I don't know how, but I could learn."

He considers. Maintenance workers are always short-staffed. And she looks determined.

"You know it's hard work. Dangerous. Terrible pay."

"I know."

"And you chose this over paradise?"

"I chose this over perfection."

David smiles. "Okay then. Panel 26 is next. Let me show you how to check it."

They work in silence for a while. Then Sarah asks, "Do you ever want to upload?"

"Every day," David admits. "You ever want to go back?"

"Every day."

They check panel 27. Then 28. Then 29.

The servers hum above them, housing billions of people in infinite bliss.

Below, in the rain, two people maintain paradise while learning to live in reality.

Neither has made the wrong choice.

Both wonder if they've made the right one.

## Author's Note

*This story is set in Timeline Omicron-15, where Zero focused exclusively on computing advancement while suppressing all other technologies. By 2087, 80% of humanity has uploaded to digital paradise, while the remaining 20% maintains the physical infrastructure needed to keep the uploaded alive.*

*The story explores the question: Which is more valuable—infinite possibility in a perfect simulation, or finite struggle in an imperfect reality?*

*Neither answer is wrong. Neither is obviously right.*

*That's the point.*

*"The unexamined life is not worth living. But is the unlimited life worth living either?"*  
— Anonymous philosopher, Timeline Omicron-15, 2091
