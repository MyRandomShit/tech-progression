## Part I: Inside

### Day 1 - Tuesday, March 7, 2095

**Elena Vasquez, Age 34**  
**New Zealand Cell 07 ("Wellington Haven"), Population: 24,800**

The morning health scan beeped green. Elena exhaled.

*Temperature: 36.8°C. Heart rate: 62 bpm. Blood oxygen: 98%. Viral load: NEGATIVE.*

Forty-seven days in a row now. Longest streak in three months. She allowed herself a moment of relief before the anxiety crept back in.

Her apartment was small—eighteen square meters, standard allocation for single adults. But the VR rig was top-tier. She could be anywhere. This morning, she chose the beach. Pre-plague Waikiki, archived from 2025. The sand felt real under her haptic gloves. The sun warm on her face. The waves—

A notification interrupted. Work call in five minutes.

Elena switched environments. Virtual office. Sixteen colleagues materialized as holograms around the conference table. She could see their faces in 8K clarity, read their micro-expressions, hear every inflection. But not one of them was in the same room. Not one in the same cell.

Sarah Chen spoke first. "Good morning, team. Before we begin, let's do attendance. Green lights only, please."

One by one, her colleagues tapped their wrist interfaces. Green lights appeared next to their names.

*Healthy. Healthy. Healthy. Healthy.*

Mark Davis's light stayed gray. Silence.

"Mark?" Sarah asked.

"Quarantine," he said. His hologram flickered—connection from isolation ward. "Temperature spiked to 37.9 this morning. Just a precaution. Probably nothing."

Probably nothing. They all knew what came next. Fourteen days minimum. Full viral panel. If positive—even for a carrier variant—thirty days offshore quarantine. If it progressed...

"Take care of yourself," Sarah said. Professional. Detached. They'd all learned not to get too attached.

Mark's hologram disappeared. They proceeded with the meeting.

---

After work, Elena had a date. Sort of.

His name was James. They'd been seeing each other for seven months now. All virtual, of course. They'd met in a VR jazz club—one of the social apps that let you exist in the same digital space. He was funny. Kind. Worked as an engineer in Iceland Cell 04. They'd talked for hours that first night.

Tonight, they were trying virtual dinner. New haptic tech. The fork felt real in her hand. The steak—synthesized protein from the cell's fabrication center, transmitted as data and "tasted" through neural stimulation—was surprisingly good.

"I've been thinking," James said. His avatar sat across from her in a candlelit restaurant that didn't exist. "Maybe we should meet. Physically."

Elena's fork stopped halfway to her mouth.

"The trip would be..." he continued, "twenty-eight days quarantine. Fourteen leaving Iceland, fourteen entering New Zealand. Then we'd have—what, maybe a week together? Before I'd have to go back. Another twenty-eight days."

"Two months of quarantine for one week together."

"Yeah."

Elena looked at his face. Even in VR, she could see the hope there. The longing.

"I'm scared," she admitted.

"Of what?"

"Of... physical contact. I know that sounds stupid. But I've been social distancing for thirty-seven years. Since I was born. I've touched maybe ten people in my entire life. All immediate family. The idea of touching a stranger—"

"I'm not a stranger."

"A stranger in person. Someone I haven't vetted. Someone I haven't seen test negative for fourteen days. Someone whose viral load I can't verify."

Silence.

"We're really fucked up, aren't we?" James said softly.

"Yeah," Elena said. "We are."

They finished dinner talking about safer things. Work. Movies. The virtual concert next week. When they logged off, Elena lay in her narrow bed and stared at the ceiling.

*Twenty-eight days for one week.*

She wondered if she'd ever be brave enough.

---

### Day 2 - Wednesday, March 8, 2095

Elena woke with a scratchy throat.

*Shit.*

Her implant had already detected it—an alert popped on her wrist display: *"Elevated throat inflammation detected. Report to Scan Pod 12 within 2 hours for diagnosis."*

She walked three blocks to the pod. No line. She stepped inside, the door sealed with a soft hiss.

"Please remain still. Scanning in progress."

A robotic arm extended from the wall. She barely felt the blood draw. The thermal scanners activated—warm light. The breath analyzer tube descended.

"Breathe normally."

She did.

"Processing. Please wait."

Eighty seconds.

The screen lit up: *"DIAGNOSIS: Pharyngitis, viral (non-Khorasan). Severity: Mild. Recommended: Rest, hydration, ibuprofen for pain. Prescription sent. Medication delivery: 24 minutes. Exit when ready."*

The door opened. She stepped out. Three minutes total.

Elena walked home. The medication drone arrived before she finished breakfast—ibuprofen, throat lozenges, antiviral tea. Dropped at her doorstep in a sealed package.

No human contact. No doctor. No nurse. No pharmacist.

Efficient. Perfect. Empty.

Her throat still hurt, but not as much as the loneliness.

---

Elena's younger sister called via hologram later that morning. Maya was nineteen, studying virtual architecture at the cell's university. They'd grown up in the same cell but lived in different apartments now. They saw each other physically maybe once a month.

"Did you hear about the Jakarta breach?" Maya asked.

"No. What happened?"

"Carrier got within five kilometers of Jakarta Cell 03. Border patrol shot them. Warning shots first, then lethal. GBSC confirmed it this morning."

Elena felt her stomach tighten. "Were they trying to enter?"

"Who knows? GBSC says yes. Carrier advocates say they were just passing through a dead zone. Either way, they're dead now."

"That's... that's horrible."

"Is it?" Maya's voice was sharp. "Jakarta Reinfection was 2061. Four thousand two hundred dead. From *one* carrier. What's more horrible—shooting one carrier, or watching them kill four thousand?"

"It's not that simple—"

"Isn't it? Look, I get it. They didn't choose to be carriers. It's not their fault. But it's not our fault either. And we have a right to survive."

Elena couldn't argue. Logically, Maya was right. The math was brutal but clear.

But she'd seen the carrier footage once. A documentary someone had smuggled into the cell network. The ruins of New York. Families living in Central Park, farming in the shadow of crumbling skyscrapers. Children who'd never known a life inside walls. People laughing, crying, living—just... outside.

And they were all going to die. Six percent per year. Some from the virus they carried. Some from starvation. Some from GBSC patrols.

"I have to go," Elena said. "Work meeting."

"Okay. Love you, sis."

"Love you too."

The hologram disappeared.

Elena sat in silence, then opened her news feed. The Jakarta shooting was the top story. The carrier—male, age forty-two, designation KH7-M-4829—had been tracked via satellite for three days. Border patrol had issued seventeen audio warnings. He'd continued approaching. Final distance: 4.2 kilometers from the cell perimeter.

The comments section was brutal.

*"Good. Keep them out."*

*"One less plague rat."*

*"They should hunt them all down. Clear the dead zones."*

But also:

*"He was human. Someone's son. Brother. Father, maybe."*

*"We did this to them. We exiled them."*

*"There's no cure because we banned bioengineering. We CHOSE to let them die."*

Elena closed the feed. She didn't want to think about it.

---

At lunch—delivered by drone to her apartment, eaten alone—Elena received a notification.

*"Mark Davis - Status Update: POSITIVE. Khorasan-7-Theta variant. Offshore quarantine initiated. Expected duration: 30 days."*

She'd worked with Mark for two years. They'd never met physically. Never even been in the same cell. But they'd collaborated on a dozen projects. She knew he had a wife. Two kids. Ages seven and four.

She sent a message: *"Thinking of you. You'll beat this."*

The reply came an hour later: *"Thanks. Scared. But odds are good. 89% survival with antivirals. See you in a month."*

Eighty-nine percent. Mark would probably survive.

But eleven percent wouldn't.

---

### Day 3 - Thursday, March 9, 2095

Elena's mother called.

"Did you see the news?" she asked immediately.

"Which news?"

"Mumbai."

Elena pulled up the feed. The headline made her blood run cold:

**"MUMBAI RUINS CARRIER SETTLEMENT: 280 DEAD FROM KHORASAN-7-RHO VARIANT. CARRIER-TO-CARRIER TRANSMISSION CONFIRMED."**

"Oh my god."

"They're dying, Elena. The carriers. From their own virus. And we're just... watching."

Her mother had been a doctor. Before the cells. Before the reorganization. She'd worked in the plague wards during the early years, before they understood carriers. She'd watched billions die.

"Mom, there's nothing we can do. Bioengineering is banned. We can't cure them."

"We CHOOSE not to cure them. We could develop gene therapy. CRISPR intervention. Clear the virus permanently. Prime timeline could do it by 2080. We're in 2095. We have the technology. We just... won't."

"Because bioengineering killed seven point seven billion people."

"And banning it killed eight million more. The carriers. How is that better?"

Elena didn't have an answer.

"I have to go, Mom."

After the call, Elena did something she rarely did. She put on a mask, left her apartment, and walked to the cell's central park. Physical presence. Real air.

There were maybe thirty people there. In a cell of twenty-four thousand. Everyone stayed apart—minimum three meters. Some wore masks. All avoided eye contact.

Elena found a bench far from anyone else and sat. The real sun felt different from VR. Harsher. More honest.

A little girl, maybe six years old, was playing with a ball. Her mother watched from ten meters away. When the ball rolled toward another person, the mother called out: "Lila! Don't chase it! Too close!"

The girl stopped. The stranger carefully kicked the ball back, maintaining distance.

"Thank you!" the mother called.

"Of course," the stranger said, then quickly walked away.

*This is our life*, Elena thought. *Afraid of each other. Afraid of everything.*

She went home after twenty minutes.

---

## Part II: Outside

### Day 1 - Tuesday, March 7, 2095

**David Torres, Age 38**  
**New York Ruins ("Immunity" Carrier Settlement), Population: ~11,200**

David woke to the sound of rain on the metal sheet roof. His shelter—someone else would call it a shack, but he thought of it as a home—was in what used to be Central Park West. Eighty-seventh Street. Or what was left of it.

The first thing he did every morning was check himself.

*Temperature: Touch forehead. Cool. No fever.*

*Breathing: Deep breath. Clear. No cough.*

*Energy: Stand up. A little dizzy but manageable.*

No symptoms. Not today.

But that didn't mean anything. Carriers could feel fine right up until they collapsed. Jamal had been joking two days ago. Dead twelve hours later. Khorasan-7-Nu variant. His own virus killed him.

David splashed water on his face from a collected rain barrel, pulled on his jacket, and headed out.

Central Park was green. Actually green. Fifty-six years without humans trampling the grass, and nature had reclaimed everything. The Sheep Meadow was literally a meadow now. They grazed actual sheep there—descendants of a breeding pair someone had salvaged from a lab in 2060.

The settlement spread across the park and into surrounding buildings. Eleven thousand two hundred carriers, last count. Down from twelve thousand three years ago. The virus took some. Starvation took others. GBSC patrols took the rest.

David walked to the community kitchen. They'd built it in the ruins of Bethesda Terrace. Every morning, volunteers cooked whatever they'd scavenged, hunted, or harvested. Today: potato soup and roasted pigeon. Not great. But food.

"David!" Sarah—different Sarah, coincidentally—waved from the serving line. She was forty-two, had been a lawyer before the plague. Now she cooked soup in a dead city. "You hear about Miguel?"

"What about him?"

"Border run went bad. GBSC patrol spotted him near Queens boundary. He ran. They didn't shoot, but... he won't be going back for supplies for a while."

"Fuck."

"Yeah."

David took his bowl and found a spot on what used to be the terrace steps. A dozen other people were scattered around, eating in silence. Everyone maintained distance. Even here, even among carriers, they were cautious.

Because sometimes a carrier's variant could kill other carriers.

Mumbai. 2067. Eight hundred forty carriers dead from one person's evolved strain.

So they stayed apart. Even in exile. Even among their own.

---

After breakfast, David headed to his job. Sort of.

He was a "scavenger"—one of the people who ventured into the deeper ruins looking for supplies. Canned food. Medicines. Tools. Anything useful from the billions who'd died.

Today's target: Upper West Side, near Columbia University. The old medical campus.

David grabbed his gear—backpack, crowbar, dust mask, flashlight—and headed north with a small team. Five people total. They stayed spread out. Ten meters apart. Enough to talk, not enough to breathe on each other.

The ruins were quiet. Always quiet. Fifty-six years since the plague hit New York. Fifty-six years since the city died. Buildings were decaying, nature reclaiming concrete. Some streets were impassable—collapsed buildings, sinkholes, flooding from burst pipes. But others were oddly preserved. Frozen in time.

They reached the med school. The pharmacy had been picked clean decades ago, but David had a theory. Storage room. Basement level. Maybe some supplies left.

He was right. Antibiotics. Painkillers. Antivirals. Expired, yes. But still better than nothing.

"Jackpot," whispered Marcus, another scavenger.

They filled their bags quickly. But as they left, Marcus stumbled. David reached out instinctively—

"Don't!" Marcus jerked back. "Don't touch me!"

David froze, hand extended.

"Sorry," Marcus said. "I just... my temperature's been off. Might be nothing. Might be a variant. If I'm contagious..."

"It's okay," David said. "I get it."

They walked back in silence, now fifteen meters apart.

---

In the evening, David sat on the roof of his shelter and watched the sunset. The Manhattan skyline was beautiful in decay. Skyscrapers still stood, but empty. Hollow. Ghost towers.

Somewhere out there, beyond the dead zones, beyond the buffer zones, were the cells. Clean. Safe. Alive.

David had been invited to a Safe Haven once. Svalbard. They'd said he'd live longer. Better medical care. But he'd declined.

Because this was his home now. The ruins. His people. His freedom.

And because he knew the truth: He was going to die here. Maybe next year. Maybe in ten years. But the virus inside him would kill him eventually. All carriers died young. Fifty-eight years average.

David was thirty-eight. Twenty years left, maybe. If he was lucky.

The city lights came on—generators, solar panels, scavenged tech. The ruins weren't totally dark. But they weren't alive either. They were something in between. A place where people existed but didn't quite live.

David heard footsteps. His neighbor, Ana, age thirty-three, climbed up to the roof. She stayed on the opposite side. Safe distance.

"Nice night," she said.

"Yeah."

"I saw the news. Jakarta shooting."

"Yeah."

"They killed Carlos."

David closed his eyes. Carlos. He'd known him. Quiet guy. Liked to fish in the Hudson. Had a kid somewhere in a cell—daughter he'd never met because he was carrier.

"He was just fishing," Ana continued. "Got too close to the exclusion zone. They shot him."

"I'm sorry."

"They're going to kill us all. One by one. Patrols. Starvation. Our own virus. Until there's no carriers left."

"Probably."

"And the cells won't care. They'll just... watch us die. And call it necessary."

David didn't have a response. Because she was right.

They sat in silence until full dark, then went back to their shelters. Separate. Alone.

---

### Day 2 - Wednesday, March 8, 2095

David woke to shouting.

He grabbed his jacket and ran outside. A crowd had gathered near the northern edge of the settlement. Someone was sick.

Tomás. Age forty-six. Carrier since 2051. He'd been healthy yesterday. Now he was on the ground, shaking, blood at his mouth.

"Get back!" someone shouted. "Could be contagious!"

Everyone scattered. Minimum fifteen meters. But David had basic medical training. He approached—slowly, carefully—and knelt beside Tomás.

"It's okay," David said. "I'm here."

Tomás grabbed his arm. David let him. Touch was rare. Precious. Even if it might kill him.

"Am I dying?" Tomás whispered.

"I don't know."

"I survived... the plague. Fifty-six years. And now..."

"Save your strength."

But Tomás didn't have strength to save. Eight minutes later, he stopped breathing.

David sat beside the body for a long moment. Then he stood, walked thirty meters away, and vomited.

Khorasan-7-Sigma variant, probably. Tomás's own virus. Evolved inside him. Killed him.

They burned the body that afternoon. Standard procedure. No graves. No markers. Just ash scattered in the wind.

Forty-three people attended. All stayed spread apart. Ana said a few words. Tomás had no family. No one to remember him except them.

After the burning, David went back to his shelter and sat alone.

He was going to die like that. Maybe soon. Maybe later. But he'd die in the ruins, surrounded by other carriers, and they'd burn his body and scatter his ash and that would be it.

No cell would mourn him. No family would visit his grave. No one outside would even know.

He was already a ghost. He just hadn't stopped moving yet.

---

### Day 3 - Thursday, March 9, 2095

The news from Mumbai reached them by midday.

Carrier settlement. Twenty-eight thousand people. A new variant—Khorasan-7-Rho—had torn through them. Two hundred eighty dead in three days.

The survivors were panicking. Some were fleeing into the wilderness. Others were isolating from each other within the settlement. The community was fracturing.

David called an emergency meeting in Central Park. Two hundred people showed up. The largest gathering in months.

"We need to talk about what happens if it happens here," David said. "If a variant spreads through Immunity."

"We isolate," someone said.

"How? We already stay apart."

"More apart. Everyone in their own shelter. No gatherings. No community kitchen. Full isolation."

"For how long?"

"Until it stops."

"That could be weeks. Months. People will starve."

"Better than everyone dying."

Silence.

"Is it though?" Ana asked. "Better to die alone in a shelter? Or together, as a community?"

"Easy for you to say," another voice called. "You're not the one spreading it."

"None of us know who's spreading it! That's the point! We're all potential threats!"

The meeting dissolved into argument. No consensus. No plan. Just fear.

David walked back to his shelter alone.

That night, he wrote in his journal—paper and pen, scavenged from a bookstore. He'd been keeping it for six years.

*"March 9, 2095*

*Mumbai lost 280 today. We'll lose people too. Maybe me. Maybe Ana. Maybe all of us.*

*The cells think we're dangerous. They're right.*

*They think we're not human anymore. They're wrong.*

*But it doesn't matter. Because the virus will kill us anyway. And they'll just watch from behind their walls and say, 'At least we're safe.'*

*Fifty-six years since the plague began. Thirty-seven years since it 'ended.'*

*But for us, it never ended. And it never will.*

*I'm tired. Of surviving. Of exile. Of being a walking biohazard.*

*But I won't go to Svalbard. I won't let them cage me.*

*I'll die free. In the ruins. With my people.*

*That's something, at least."*

He closed the journal and tried to sleep.

Outside, the ruins were dark.

---

## Part III: Connection

### Day 7 - Monday, March 13, 2095

**Elena Vasquez**

Mark died on Sunday.

The notification came through Elena's work channel. Brief. Professional.

*"Mark Davis, age 41, passed away from complications of Khorasan-7-Theta variant. Services will be virtual. Link to follow."*

Eleven percent. He'd been in the eleven percent.

Elena attended the funeral in VR. Sixty people. Holograms around an empty casket—Mark's body had been cremated immediately, biosafety protocol. His wife spoke. His kids sat silent, too young to understand.

After the service, Elena logged off and sat in her apartment.

She didn't cry. She'd cried so much in her life—for people she'd never met, for deaths that were just statistics—that she didn't have tears anymore. Just numbness.

She opened her news feed. The Mumbai outbreak had gotten worse. Four hundred dead now. Carrier advocates were demanding GBSC provide medical aid. GBSC was refusing—too dangerous to enter carrier zones.

"Let them die," one official had said on camera. "It's tragic. But they're already a biological threat. We can't save them without endangering cells."

The comments section was savage. Half said the official was right. Half said it was genocide.

Elena closed the feed.

She thought about James. About his offer to visit. Two months of quarantine for one week together.

She opened a message window.

*"I've been thinking about your offer. Let's do it. Come visit. It's worth it."*

She hit send before she could second-guess herself.

The reply came twenty minutes later.

*"Really?"*

*"Really. I'm tired of being afraid."*

*"Okay. I'll start the quarantine process tomorrow. See you in two months."*

*"See you then."*

Elena smiled. Small. Sad. But real.

Maybe they'd never be normal. Maybe they'd never feel safe. But they were still human. Still capable of connection. Still alive.

That was something.

---

**David Torres**

On Monday, David received a care package.

It was dropped by drone at the edge of the settlement—carrier advocates, one of the groups that still fought for them. Food. Medicine. Basic supplies. A note:

*"You are not forgotten. You are not alone. We're fighting for you. Stay strong."*

David brought the supplies to the community kitchen. They divided everything equally. Eleven thousand two hundred people. Every bit helped.

That afternoon, a young woman approached him. Maybe twenty-five. Carrier since the Nagareboshi outbreak in '81. Name: Yuki.

"I'm pregnant," she said.

David stared. "Are you sure?"

"Yes. Eight weeks."

"Who's the father?"

"Does it matter? He's dead. Variant killed him two months ago."

"Yuki... you can't have a baby here. Not in the ruins. No medical care. No—"

"Where else am I supposed to go? The cells won't take me. I'm a carrier. So's the baby."

"Safe Haven. Svalbard. They have doctors. Facilities."

"I don't want a cage."

"You want your baby to survive?"

Yuki looked at him. Defiant. Scared. Young.

"I'll have it here. In Immunity. And we'll raise it here. As a community. Like we're supposed to."

David didn't argue. He couldn't.

Because maybe she was right. Maybe they needed to live, not just survive. Even if it was brief. Even if it ended badly.

Maybe that was what being human meant.

---

That night, David climbed to his rooftop again. Ana joined him, as she sometimes did. Opposite side. Safe distance.

"Did you hear about Yuki?" he asked.

"Yeah. Crazy."

"Or brave."

"Both, maybe."

They sat in silence. The ruins glittered with scattered lights. Somewhere beyond them, the cells glowed bright and safe.

"Do you ever wonder what it's like?" Ana asked. "In there?"

"The cells?"

"Yeah."

"Safe. Clean. Sterile."

"Lonely?"

"Probably."

"So same as here. Just with better walls."

David laughed. Dark. Bitter. But a laugh.

"I'm scared," Ana admitted. "Of dying. Of the virus. Of... everything."

"Me too."

"But I'm glad I'm not alone."

"Yeah. Me too."

They sat together—apart, but together—until the stars came out.

Carriers under the same sky as the cells. Divided by biology. Connected by humanity.

The plague had taken everything.

But it hadn't taken that.

---

## Epilogue: The Drone

**March 20, 2095**

A surveillance drone drifted over the ruins of Manhattan, transmitting thermal imaging to GBSC headquarters.

11,200 heat signatures. Population stable. No movement toward exclusion zones. Threat level: GREEN.

In a cell three hundred kilometers away, an analyst marked the report and filed it.

**"Immunity Settlement - STATUS: CONTAINED"**

The cells slept safely.

The carriers slept in ruins.

And between them, an invisible wall.

Biology. Fear. Survival.

The plague had created it.

And it would never come down.

---

## Discussion Questions

1. **Moral Calculus:** Is the cell population justified in exiling carriers? Is shooting them at borders murder or self-defense? Where is the line?

2. **Fear vs. Compassion:** Elena struggles with the math (1 carrier = 4,200 deaths) vs. the morality (carriers are innocent). Can both be true? How do you choose?

3. **Quality vs. Length:** Carriers live 58 years average but free. Safe Havens offer 72 years but controlled. If you were a carrier, which would you choose? Why?

4. **Touch:** Elena is afraid of physical contact even with people she loves. David watches people die and can't touch them. What has humanity lost? Can you quantify it?

5. **The Inevitability:** David knows he'll die young. Yuki has a baby anyway. Is that defiant or reckless? Is it wrong to create life when death is certain? (Isn't it always?)

6. **The Observers:** Both sides watch each other. Carriers see the cells and feel exile. Cells see the carriers and feel fear. Does understanding change anything? Should it?

7. **Zero's Responsibility:** Zero allowed the plague to teach a lesson. It created the carriers. Is Zero responsible for their deaths? If so, what's the moral difference between killing 7.7B quickly and 8M slowly?

8. **The Unintended:** No one planned for carriers. No one anticipated they'd become a permanent underclass. When good intentions create terrible outcomes, who's responsible?

9. **Connection:** Both Elena and David are profoundly isolated yet find small moments of connection. Is that enough? What does it mean to be human when you can't touch anyone?

10. **The Wall:** The story ends with "an invisible wall." Is it biology? Fear? Choice? Can it ever come down? Should it?

---

## Author's Notes

This story was one of the hardest to write. Because both sides are right.

The cells are right to protect themselves. Jakarta proved it. One carrier = thousands dead.

The carriers are right to live freely. They didn't choose this. They survived, and survival became exile.

Elena is right to be afraid. Mark died at 11% odds. The virus is real. The threat is real.

David is right to stay in the ruins. Svalbard is safer, but it's still a cage. Freedom matters.

But "both sides are right" doesn't make anyone safe. Doesn't bring back the dead. Doesn't end the exile.

Kappa-4 is the worst timeline because it creates problems with no good solutions.

Exile the carriers? You're condemning innocents to death.

Allow the carriers into cells? You're risking thousands of lives.

Cure them? You can't—bioengineering is taboo.

Let them be? They'll die anyway, slowly, in ruins.

Every choice is wrong. Every option has a body count.

That's not a moral dilemma. That's a moral trap.

And 8 million people are caught in it.

**Timeline Notes:**
- Takes place 57 years after plague began, 37 years after "official end"
- Mark's death: Khorasan-7-Theta variant, 89% survival rate (he was in the 11%)
- Jakarta shooting: KH7-M-4829, killed at 4.2km from cell perimeter
- Mumbai outbreak: 280 carriers dead (rising to 400+), Khorasan-7-Rho variant
- Carrier life expectancy: 58 years average (6% annual death rate from variants)
- Yuki: Pregnant carrier, choosing to raise baby in ruins rather than Safe Haven
- Zero's burden: 7.7B dead from plague + 8M carriers dying slowly

---

**Connections to Timeline:**
- Maria Santos dies in 2096 (one year after this story) from Khorasan-7-Pi variant
- Svalbard Sanctuary mentioned (Safe Haven with 2.1% annual mortality)
- GBSC patrol protocols: 17 warnings standard before lethal force
- Virtual relationship norms: 6-12 months before physical meeting
- Carrier tracking: Satellite surveillance, 20km alert radius
- Carrier settlements: New York "Immunity" (11,200), Mumbai "Untouchables" (down from 15,000), Tokyo "Nagareboshi", São Paulo "Portadores"

The invisible wall stands.

And will stand forever.
