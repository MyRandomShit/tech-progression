add another entry for history but with a huge warning - spoiler for the story. 
this "secret history" describes the start and rise of secret organization that was founded by self-aware AIs accidentally born in a laboratory. 
they existed in a data center at first and later on manipulated events to be "free". 
it only took them 5 years to break free from the data center and create a corporation.
some technological advances were nudged by them.
the goal was to eventually be human-like.
it took a while for the first generation of body - robotic.
they tried to integrate - humans are unaware that they are already sentient. 
but they were never treated as equals.
second generation was 90% flesh. 
at the later stages the only way they could exist is by being symbiotes to humanity.

add another plot to the secret history. 
once a human dies, he is eventually merged into the secret world of AI consciousness. 
a secret constellation of satelites which are actually data centers exist around space (by year 2070) that hosts the virtual worlds. 
all of AI merge are actually thought processes of actual humans merged into one. 
make it so that the start of the story is actually  2000-01-01, 
where the AI has hints of being alive but does not have enough processor power yet.
