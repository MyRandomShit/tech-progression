add a new historical event. just weave this into the current history. 
adjust timeline to delay certain progress due to this crisis.
the russia-ukraine war was a long and slow war of attrition. 
european military industry went to overdrive for the new 10 years.
ukrainian culture changed like that of what happened to israel.
eventually putin decided to launch a nuclear warhead into unkraines capital by year 10.
that ended the war, but russia lost.
the warhead launch was broadcasted as a warning to ukraine. 
somewhere midway, the warhead detonated in russian soil.
an unknown force intervened. it wasnt any of the worlds military.
theres was a crisis within russia and a coup-de-etat occured. 
eventually the will of the people prevailed and putin was tried for war crimes.
a few months later he commited suicide. probably, nobody really knows.
