# Book 02 - The Transformation (2060-2085)

## Era Context

The world has changed beyond recognition from the early 21st century. The choices made in Book 01 have borne fruit—or consequences.

By 2060:
- Global Union dominates, but tensions with holdouts persist
- Nano-biomachines are widespread, reshaping human capability
- Contribution economy has replaced traditional capitalism in most of the world
- Space mining has triggered material abundance and economic upheaval
- AI quietly orchestrates more of human activity than most realize
- The integrated and unintegrated diverge into different kinds of humans

This is the era of consolidation, where humanity discovers what it means to live in a post-scarcity world—and whether the price of peace was too high.
