# Book 01 - The Beginning (2035-2060)

This is where the story begins.

## Era Context

The world stands at a crossroads. The 2020s and early 2030s saw unprecedented technological advancement, but also crisis: climate emergency, resource wars, democratic backsliding, and the emergence of technologies that could either save or destroy humanity.

By 2035, transformation begins:
- Global Union expansion accelerates
- Nano-biomachines emerge from research labs
- AI systems become increasingly sophisticated
- Material economy begins its collapse
- Traditional institutions strain under change

This is the era of transition, uncertainty, and the first glimpses of what humanity could become.
