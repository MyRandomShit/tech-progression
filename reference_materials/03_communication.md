## Key Developments

### Network Infrastructure
Communication evolved from electromagnetic waves to quantum-biological systems:
- **Quantum entanglement networks** (2035-2045): Zero-latency communication regardless of distance
- **Biological relay systems** (2040-2055): Living tissue infrastructure for nano-scale communication
- **Coherence maintenance** (2055-2065): Keeping billions of quantum states synchronized
- **Hive consciousness substrate** (2065-2070): Communication network enabling collective intelligence

### Communication Protocols
- 2030: Molecular signaling supplements electromagnetic communication
- 2045: Hybrid bio-digital protocols enable cell-machine interaction
- 2060: Quantum coherence protocols coordinate billions of nano-processors
- 2070: Hive mind protocols enable trillion-node synchronized consciousness

### Impact on Society
The transition to quantum-biological communication networks enabled the hive mind architecture essential for nano-biomachines. By 2070, communication occurred simultaneously across all scales—from individual molecules within cells to coordinated actions across entire organisms. This multi-scale communication infrastructure allowed nano-biomachines to function as both independent units and as parts of a unified, conscious collective.
