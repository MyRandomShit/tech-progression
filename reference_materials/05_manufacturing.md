## Key Developments

### Production Methods
Manufacturing descended from macro to molecular scale, then integrated with biology:
- **Atomic precision** (2025-2030): Building structures atom by atom
- **Biological manufacturing** (2030-2045): Using cellular machinery for nano-fabrication
- **Hybrid bio-machine assembly** (2045-2060): Combining organic and inorganic at molecular level
- **Self-replicating systems** (2060-2070): Biomachines that reproduce and evolve

### Materials Science
Key materials enabling nano-biomachines:
- **Biocompatible quantum dots** (2030s): Computing substrates cells tolerate
- **Protein-metal hybrids** (2040s): Strength of metals with flexibility of biology
- **Smart polymers** (2050s): Materials responding to biological signals
- **Living composites** (2060s): Indistinguishable from natural cellular components

### Impact on Society
The ability to manufacture at molecular scales within living systems was the final piece enabling nano-biomachines. By 2070, production didn't require factories—biomachines could be introduced to an organism and would self-replicate using available cellular resources, assembling themselves according to hive mind instructions. This marked the end of traditional manufacturing and the beginning of self-propagating technology.
