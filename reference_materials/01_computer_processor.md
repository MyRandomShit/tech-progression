## Key Developments

### Processing Architecture
The evolution from silicon to biological substrates enabled computing at the cellular and sub-cellular level. Key breakthroughs included:
- **Quantum coherence** at room temperature (2040s)
- **Molecular logic gates** using engineered proteins (2050s)
- **Distributed intelligence** across billions of coordinated nano-processors (2060s)
- **Bio-quantum integration** allowing living cells to host computational systems (2065-2070)

### Performance Metrics
- 2025: ~10^15 operations/second (traditional supercomputers)
- 2040: ~10^20 operations/second (quantum-classical hybrid systems)
- 2060: ~10^25 operations/second (distributed nano-processor networks)
- 2070: ~10^30 operations/second (hive-coordinated biomachine collectives)

### Impact on Society
The progression toward nano-scale, biologically-integrated processors fundamentally changed medicine, manufacturing, and human augmentation. By 2070, the line between living tissue and computing systems had effectively dissolved, enabling nano-biomachines to operate within living organisms while maintaining coordinated hive intelligence.
