## Key Developments

### Nano-Scale Transportation
Transportation at human scales became autonomous, while nano-scale mobility evolved:
- **Molecular motors** (2025-2035): Adapting nature's engines for artificial purposes
- **Cellular hitchhiking** (2035-2050): Using body's natural transport systems
- **Coordinated swarm movement** (2050-2065): Hive mind directing collective navigation
- **Omnidirectional access** (2065-2070): Reaching any cell in an organism on demand

### Macro Transportation
- 2030: Hyperloop and autonomous vehicles dominate surface transport
- 2045: Electric aircraft and drone networks for regional travel
- 2060: Most transportation at human scale is automated and optimized by AI
- 2070: Traditional transportation less relevant as humans integrate with technology

### Impact on Society
While human-scale transportation became fully automated and efficient, the real revolution occurred at the nano-scale. By 2070, nano-biomachines could navigate through the human body to any destination, using the circulatory system, lymphatic networks, and even moving directly through tissue. This enabled targeted medical interventions, body modification, and integration of biological and technological systems at the cellular level.
