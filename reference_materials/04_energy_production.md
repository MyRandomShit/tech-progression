## Key Developments

### Power Generation Methods
Energy technology miniaturized and biologized to enable nano-scale operations:
- **Molecular energy storage** (2025-2035): Individual molecules as batteries
- **Biological energy harvesting** (2030-2050): Tapping ATP and metabolic processes
- **Quantum energy sources** (2045-2060): Nuclear isomers and vacuum energy at nano-scale
- **Metabolic integration** (2060-2070): Biomachines powered by host organism's natural processes

### Energy Storage
- 2025: 500 Wh/kg (advanced lithium batteries)
- 2035: 10,000 Wh/kg (quantum dot storage)
- 2050: 100,000 Wh/kg (nuclear isomer cells)
- 2070: Indefinite operation via metabolic harvesting

**Critical Breakthrough**: The ability to power nano-scale devices indefinitely by harvesting energy from cellular metabolism was essential for autonomous biomachine operation. Without solving nano-scale energy storage, hive mind coordination would drain power faster than it could be replenished.

### Impact on Society
Energy independence at the nano-scale revolutionized what was possible. By 2070, nano-biomachines could operate indefinitely within living organisms, drawing power from the same metabolic processes that sustain cells. This eliminated the need for external power sources and enabled truly autonomous biomachine collectives that could live symbiotically within biological systems.
