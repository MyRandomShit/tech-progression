## Key Developments

### Medical Advances
Bioengineering progressed from editing genes to creating hybrid life-machine systems:
- **Precision genome editing** (2025-2030): Perfect control over genetic code
- **Synthetic life** (2030-2045): Creating living systems with novel properties
- **Bio-machine hybrids** (2045-2060): Merging biological and mechanical at cellular level
- **Nano-biomachines** (2060-2070): Machines so small they function as cellular organelles

**Critical Integration**: The nano-biomachine breakthrough required:
1. **Computing miniaturization** - processors small enough to fit in cells
2. **AI hive mind** - coordinating billions of units as unified intelligence
3. **Energy solutions** - nano-scale perpetual power from metabolism
4. **Bioengineering** - making machines compatible with living tissue

### Genetic Engineering
- 2030: Complete control over cellular behavior via synthetic chromosomes
- 2045: Cells simultaneously alive and digitally programmable
- 2060: Machines grown as natural part of cellular development
- 2070: No distinction between "natural" organelles and nano-machines

### Impact on Society
By 2070, the culmination of all technological progress converged in nano-biomachines: living cells containing microscopic machines with hive mind intelligence, powered by cellular metabolism, capable of coordinating in the trillions while functioning as parts of a living organism. This marked the merger of biology and technology into a single, inseparable entity. Medicine, human augmentation, and life itself transformed as the boundary between living and machine dissolved.
