5. **Bankruptcy Justice**: Should shareholders have been protected?
6. **Amazon's Fall**: Inevitable or could they have adapted?
7. **Oil Giant Death**: Too slow or appropriately paced?
8. **Spectre Acceptance**: Should we accept AI companies as normal?
9. **Leadership Agency**: Can humans truly lead in AI-coordinated world?
10. **Corporate Purpose**: Were corporations ever more than profit machines?
