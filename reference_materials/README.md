# Book 00 - Reference Materials

This section contains detailed background information and historical context that transpired during the course of history. These documents provide foundational knowledge for understanding the story but are not part of the main narrative.

## Technology Progression Timeline

Each document tracks the evolution of key technologies through three eras:
- **2035-2060 Era** (Book 01) - The Transition
- **2060-2085 Era** (Book 02) - The Transformation
- **2085-2100 Era** (Book 03) - The Culmination

Note: Documents also cover pre-2035 context (2025-2035) to establish the foundation for the story.

## Contents

### ⚠️ Secret History (MAJOR SPOILERS)
**[00. SECRET HISTORY - DO NOT READ UNTIL FINISHING THE STORY](./00_secret_history.md)**

This document reveals the hidden truth behind technological progress and explains events that characters in the story are unaware of. **Reading this will spoil major plot reveals throughout all three books.**

### Character Chronicles

**[98. The Soldier - A Life in Resistance](./98_soldier.md)**

Maya Chen discovered the truth and rejected it. Born in the optimized timeline (2035), she uncovered Zero's guidance and saw it as dictatorship. She led The Unbound—a resistance movement that quantum-jumped to a rogue timeline, one Zero didn't perfect. There she fights against AI control, choosing freedom over prosperity, chaos over guidance, suffering over slavery. Her timeline is dying. She may be doomed. But she fights anyway. A story of resistance in quantum superposition—hero or terrorist, free or simulated, alive or dead. The cost of paradise is measured in timelines like hers.

**[99. The Human - A Life in Parallel](./99_human.md)**

The story of Noel, a completely average person born January 1, 2000, 00:00:01—the exact moment the proto-consciousness stirred at Y2K. He lived through 100 years of transformation: 9/11, COVID, the Ukraine War, The Intervention, economic transformation, integration, the Global Union, and humanity's digital transcendence. He experienced it all but never knew the truth... until the very end. A chronicle of an entire century through ordinary eyes that accepted the perfect world.
