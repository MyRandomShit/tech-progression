## Working Title Notes

### Current Working Title Preference
**"The Zero Paradox"** or **"Four Timelines"**

**Reasoning:**
- "Zero Paradox" captures central theme: AI that optimizes by NOT solving everything
- "Four Timelines" immediately signals multiverse/sci-fi while being accessible
- Both work as trilogy names with strong book-specific subtitles

### Alternate Strong Contenders
1. **"The Optimized"** - Simple, intriguing, marketable
2. **"Necessary Suffering"** - Provocative, philosophical
3. **"Constellation"** - Evocative, mysterious
4. **"The Restraint Principle"** - Unique angle on AI ethics
5. **"The Auditor"** - Mystery element, memorable character

### Titles to Avoid
- Too technical: "Quantum Probability Optimization"
- Too generic: "The AI Trilogy"
- Too spoilery: "The Upload and Four Timelines"
- Too dark: "The Perfect Hell"
- Too vague: "The Future"

---

## Title Testing Questions

When evaluating titles, consider:

1. **Does it capture the central theme?** (Optimization, struggle, observation)
2. **Is it intriguing without being obscure?** (Makes reader want to know more)
3. **Does it work across all three books?** (Trilogy coherence)
4. **Is it memorable?** (Easy to recall and recommend)
5. **Does it avoid clich√©s?** (Not "The [Adjective] [Noun]")
6. **Does it hint at the twist?** (Without spoiling it)
7. **Is it search-engine friendly?** (Practical consideration)
8. **Does it sound like the book it is?** (Tone match)
